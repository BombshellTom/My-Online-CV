      I was required to sit multiple exams, learn a new business, including all
      the technical terms, and be able to use that knowledge immediately to solve
      issues that arose for clients. This included:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Collecting and holding onto confidential documents. Then scanning the
        documents and forwarding them securely to a provider. This process had a
        zero error, 100% compliance requirement to be met.
      </li>
      <li>
        Responsible for providing a lender with all information needed for them to
        make a decision on whether to accept a mortgage application worth six
        figures.

      My responsibilities were far greater, and I was allowed more freedom
      in creating business opportunities, competing for and winning
      listings, as well as the usual role of lettings. I was also given
      more freedom and responsibility for the office budget, and more
      pressure to hit deadlines and/or targets.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Maintaining and continually adapt the business model in Lettings </li>
      <li>Running a successful office, including managing people </li>

      I worked in a brand-new office and new area which was challenging as
      lettings take time to build up stock, applicants, and brand awareness.
      However, despite being the youngest in my office I was consistently one
      of the top two negotiators in the office for my duration there.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Overseeing meet-and-greets between tenants and landlords
      </li>
      <li>
        Explaining agencies fee structures to both tenants and landlords
      </li>
      <li>
        Explaining contract clauses to both tenants and landlords,
        making sure they thoroughly understand them before proceeding
      </li>
      <li>
        Delivering weekly reports of product availability to colleagues in
        neighbouring offices and applicants
      </li>
      <li>
        Visiting properties prior to tenancies commencing and reporting any
        faults or breaches of contract to both tenant and landlord
      </li>
      <li>
        Closing to office on a regular basis, ensuring everything is secure
        but also tidy
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Aside from learning the skills of property negotiation, I have also
      received training in e-mail etiquette, driving in London, and limited
      legal training in the context of writing contracts for property rentals.
